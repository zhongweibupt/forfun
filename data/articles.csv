Invoice Status,"Dear all-   Below you can find PO requisition for Cypromed with %28 VAT. Despite accurate PO requisition, the invoice was incorrectly issued(%8 VAT and withholding tax)by the supplier which contradicts with the PO. Then the invoice was processed through IP(for the rest of the amount) where the VAT rate on the PO has been altered in order to match with the invoice. While  doing so no finance recommendation has been asked and we came up with inaccurate booking of the attached invoice.   In order to avoid these type of issues, I would strongly recommend you to consult with local finance team before applying any alteration to book these invoices.   Thanks in advance for your cooperation.     Ersin Bozkurt Cost Analyst/MCI   aabbcc aabbcc  MedikalTeknoloji Ticaret Ltd.  ?ti.

I believe both are options but will confirm after I spoke the Swiss BU Director. Denis himself is on holidays. I think Denis would already be happy with getting the transporter from Carlsbad to Switzerland where they would use it for promotion purposes (Sorry, I really thought that it was Carlsbad in Europe J ).   It would be great if you had a name I could contact for the item in Carlsbad. In the meantime I will check with Switzerland to get an idea of how many of these items they estimate that they could sell.   Thanks Tobias   Tobias Moldt Team Leader Customer Services Austria & Switzerland     aabbcc Block G First Floor, Cherrywood Business Park, Loughlinstown, Dublin 28 Ireland   Telephone: +353 2 432 3055   e-mail: tobias.moldt@aabbccaaabbb             From: Grant, Richard Sent: 24 September 2025 22:43 To: Moldt, Tobias Subject: RE: PB280 Vent transport solution {3862682}   Hi Tobias,   I can see two possible solutions:   2.        Denis purchases this item against his samples / demo account from Carlsbad and the product is shipped directly from Carlsbad in the US to Switzerland. I believe that this should be done using the US customer Services and Planning Teams, I should be able to get you some names if you need any help here. 2.        If Denis plans to sell more of this item then I suggest that we get it set up on JBA. This will mean that we can make use of the existing supply chain to get the stock from Carlsbad to OPG and then on to Switzerland. The only issue with this is getting the code set up on JBA which will take some time, and questions may be asked if there is not any plans to sell additional quantities of this item.   Thanks   Regards Richard Grant Senior Planner European Logistics aabbcc Basingstoke, UK Tel:&nbs"

Last month there was an urgent MPR payment in epq during the closing on D+2 that made quite a communication around. As all the payments created are going directly to bank account, all such payments done within D+2, +2 before closing of Cash Management will cause difference on the bank account. Therefore I would like to know which approach you prefer to choose:   2.        process the MPR even if the Cash management hasn?t been closed yet ? will be explained in BSR as reconciling item 2.        wait once the CM?s closed, then process the MPR in a new period (from our site could be closed already on D+2 evening)   Thanks Kind regards, Dagmar"
